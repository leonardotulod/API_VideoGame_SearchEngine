						<p>“No Xavier, you can’t go to Marshall’s house, you know we have to pack!” Sad, I resignedly dedicate myself to packing my bags for our annual trip to France and India to see family. For my 14-year-old self, the trips meant that I would have to go without seeing my friends or going to fun camps for an entire month. My multiracial heritage as a son of two immigrants seemed nothing more than a complete waste of my summer. At the time, I thought that France was full of rude and self-righteous people who hated Americans, while India smelled so bad it seemed like I couldn’t shake the smell off my clothes for weeks when we came back. However, while in India, I took a walk that would drastically change my opinion on these family trips. I was walking to visit a special grotto, doing my best to ignore the smell when my wandering mind led me to ask myself “Why does India smell so bad?” “Cause there’s a lot of poop”. “Why’s there a lot of poop?”. “Because people don’t have sewage systems.” “Why don’t they have sewage systems?” “Because they don’t have houses”. This never-ending back and forth forced me towards a line of questioning that I had never even considered before, until I came to the realization that these innocent people were stuck where they were, with no one to care for them, living in squalid poverty. There was a newly constructed, high-tech hospital less than a mile away, but because they didn’t have the money, they couldn't afford to get treated there. Many of them were disabled in some way, preventing them from even the meager income that the intensive manual labor jobs offered and relegating them to begging, and sooner or later, dying. For the first time, I truly empathized with others who had a completely different background than me. </p>
						<p>While I wasn’t able to actually do anything meaningful to help those I saw, once I came back home, I was all the more aware of the problems in my own community, and itching to do something to help. I signed up for the Young Men’s Service League, a service organization that would allow me to easily find charities and other local organizations that were in desperate need of volunteers. I made it a personal goal to serve the most hours out of anyone in the organization. However, school quickly came in the way and before I knew it, the year was over and I placed a disappointing third place in service hours. That summer, I learned from my mistakes and made my goal a priority, basing my choices around my commitment to serve. I volunteered more hours for fewer charities, allowing me to really get to know the people who I was helping and stop looking at them as people in need and more as friends. As the year progressed, I made sure to never lose track of my goal, continuing to serve those in need despite the temptation to just focus on school work or spend more time with friends. By the end of the year I had accomplished my goal. </p>
						<p>Because of this experience, service has been a core part of my personality. In highschool, I served the most hours of my graduating class, and the organizations I have continued to be a part of in college have reflected this same mindset:</p>

						<h3 class="feature-title">ASSIST</h3>
						<!--<img src="images/column-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">-->
						<p>ASSIST (Aggies Selflessly Serving In Shaping Tomorrow) is a service-oriented Freshmen Leadership Organization on campus. As a freshman, I chose a local nonprofit to partner with in order to raise money and volunteer with. This experience was one of the first in which I had complete control of what organization I would to help and how I wanted to serve, allowing me to take even more responsibility for my service.</p>

						<h3 class="feature-title">John 15</h3>
						<!--<img src="images/column-2.jpg" class="img-fluid">-->
						<p>John 15 is a religious organization oriented towards freshmen, designed to give them the community and faith that they will need during their college years. I have served for almost 2 years in this organization, doing my best to guide my freshmen through the turbulent waters of the transition to college so that they can develop into the best versions of themselves.</p>
						<p>With John 15, I have also been able to serve in the local Bryan/College Station community. I volunteer at <a href="https://www.twincitymission.org/" target=”_blank”>Twin City Mission</a>, a homeless shelter in Bryan, <a href="https://www.buildtamu.com/" target=”_blank”>BUILD</a>, an organization on campus that builds mobile hospitals in container boxes, and <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target=”_blank”>Big Event</a>, a day of service in which thousands of Aggies give back to the local community by helping residents with housework.</p>
